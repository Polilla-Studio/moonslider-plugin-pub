## We tried to make it easy for you

Just go to the backend, clic on create slider, select the general options and that's it.

Then go to slides, create all the slides you need uploading your images or video and assign them to a slider with one single click. Reuse the created slides for new sliders if you need it.

Go to your backend editor, add the component ```{% moonSlider %}``` to your template and voila! you have a fully functional and responsive slider working in your site.

### Working with another Slider Library

The plugins injects to the page all the slider and slides info in a set of organic variables easy to use with any slider front end creator. (slick slider, easySlide, ... etc)
