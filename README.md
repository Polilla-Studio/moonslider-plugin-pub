###User Sam

We tried to make it easy for you

Just go to the backend, clic on create slider, select the general options and that's it.

Then go to slides, create all the slides you need uploading your images or video and assign them to a slider with one single click. Reuse the created slides for new sliders if you need it.

Go to your backend editor, add the component {% moonSlider %} to your template and voila! you have a fully functional and responsive slider working in your site.

###User Jules
Do the same steps Sam.

Now you can edit the CSS in order to customize the colors of the markers, buttons or controls buttons. Don't worry, all the responsive stuff is managed for the plugin so you don't need to worried about this. However, if you need to customize something else, the CSS file it's easy to read and well documented

###User Andy

You can build your own slider with the front end library you prefer and use this plugin to manage all the backend logic and settings for images, dates of activation, relations between slides and sliders, etc.

The plugins injects to the page all the slider and slides info in a set of organic variables easy to use with any slider front end creator. (slick slider, easySlide, ... etc)
